        <h1>Zerosum Studios Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Zerosum Studios we have a few fundamental principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We don&#39;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it.
(We can&#39;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender
or income level for no apparent reason).</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t share your personal information with anyone except to
comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</p></li>
<li><p>We don&#39;t store personal information on our servers unless required
for the on-going operation of one of our services.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Zerosum Studios, S.A. de C.V. (&quot;Zerosum Studios&quot;) creates games 
for iOS, Mac and Android. It is Zerosum Studios&#39; policy to
respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while
operating our apps or our website at www.zerosumstudios.com.</p>

<h2>Aggregated Statistics</h2>

<p>Zerosum Studios may collect statistics about the behavior of people using
its applications. For instance, Zerosum Studios may monitor how many times
an app is used, how much time is spent in that app, how many games were won
or lost and other information about the usage of the application. Zerosum
Studios may display this information publicly or provide it to others.
However, Zerosum Studios does not disclose personally-identifying
information other than as described below. We do not collect personally-identifying
information in our statistics and the results are generally viewed in
aggregate. Collection of these statistics helps us improve our applications
and their performance.</p>

<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>

<p>Zerosum Studios discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Zerosum Studios&#39; behalf or to provide services available in
ZerosumStudios&#39;s applications, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to
others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may
be located outside of your home country; by using Zerosum Studios&#39; applications,
you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Zerosum Studios will not
rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Zerosum Studios discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response
to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Zerosum Studios
believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the
property or rights of Zerosum Studios, third parties or the public at large. If you
are a registered user of an Zerosum Studios website and have supplied your email
address, Zerosum Studios may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what&#39;s going
on with Zerosum Studios and our products. If you send us a request (for example via
a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to
publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us
support other users. Zerosum Studios takes all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
